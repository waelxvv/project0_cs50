# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Below is the list of requirmeent. For each I am listing the page you will find an example of the specific requirments.


# Task: 
    Your website must contain at least four different .html pages, and it should be possible to get from any page on your website to any other page by following one or more hyperlinks.
# Work: 
    The project have the following pages:
    1. index.html
    2. bs_butons.html
    3. bs_component.html
    4. bs_layout.html
    All pages have a top nav with links that allow you to navigate from page to page.`
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Task: 
    Your website must include at least one list (ordered or unordered), at least one table, and at least one image.
# Work:
    index.html have an unorder list and images. You will see another image on the page bs_component.html. I use a table on the page bs_buttons.html
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Task:
    Your website must have at least one stylesheet file.
# Work:
    All pages include/link to the stylesheet file name my.css (a file I generate from my.cscc)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    

# Task:
    Your stylesheet(s) must use at least five different CSS properties, and at least five different types of CSS selectors. You must use the #id selector at least once, and the .class selector at least once.
# Work:
    In the file my.css you will find lots of CSS properties: ex. padding, color, content, font-size, border, etc. I am using many different CSS selectors include id-selection, class-selection, use of "," & use of ">" & user of ":", and use of [property=value], etc.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   

# Task:
    Your stylesheet(s) must include at least one mobile-responsive @media query, such that something about the styling changes for smaller screens.
# Work:
    I included such @media query. It will change the top-navigation and add background-color so you can clearly see the effect of the screen width.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   

# Task:
    You must use Bootstrap 4 on your website, taking advantage of at least one Bootstrap component, and using at least two Bootstrap columns for layout purposes using Bootstrapâ€™s grid model.
# Work:
    3 of my pages: bs_butons.html, bs_component.html, and bs_layout.html are using the Bootstrap CSS where I am using all the tasks required.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   

# Task:
    Your stylesheets must use at least one SCSS variable, at least one example of SCSS nesting, and at least one use of SCSS inheritance.
# Work:
    The file my.scss have 2 variables for colors. I am using 2 SCSS neting (look at p:hover and li:hover). Look at "li + li:after" and ".note" to see a use of inheritance
